  text: A hybrid solar eclipse, also known as a "annular-total eclipse," is a rare
    type of eclipse that starts as an annular eclipse and transitions into a total
    eclipse (or vice versa) along its path of totality. The type of eclipse experienced
    at a specific location along the path depends on various factors, including the
    observer's position and the relative distances between the Earth, Moon, and Sun.
