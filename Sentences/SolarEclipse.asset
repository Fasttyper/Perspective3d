  text: A solar eclipse is a natural astronomical event that occurs when the Moon
    passes between the Earth and the Sun, temporarily blocking the Sun's light and
    casting a shadow on the Earth. During a solar eclipse, the Moon aligns in such
    a way that it covers part or all of the Sun's disk as seen from a specific location
    on Earth.
